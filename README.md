# Project Title: Resy Bot

## Collaborators
Mark Lung ([github](https://github.com/ml6754)), Zack Goldberg, Aditya Pradeep([github](https://github.com/adityapradeep12)) ,Geoffrey Budiman, Rayhan Ahmed

## Vision Statement
Resy Bot aims to obtain reservations at popular and hard to get into restaurants. As NYC continues to open up post-pandemic, popular restaurants are harder to get reservations at, but with Resy Bot, you are able to get a reservation at any restaurant of your liking! For whoever wants to get a reservation at a restaurant of their choosing. Web app where you can select a restaurant and timing(s) of when you want to go. Resy Bot will then wait for the reservation to be open and snipe it instantly, then will email or send a text message regarding the reservation.
