# Project Repository

This repository will be used for team projects.

Several sets of instructions are included in this repository. They should each be treated as separate assignments with their own due dates and sets of requirements.

1. See the [App Map & Wireframes](instructions-0a-app-map-wireframes.md) and [Prototyping](./instructions-0b-prototyping.md) instructions for the requirements of the initial user experience design of the app.

## Project Title: Resy Bot

### What and why?
Resy Bot aims to obtain reservations at popular and hard to get into restaurants. As NYC continues to open up post-pandemic, popular restaurants are harder to get reservations at, but with Resy Bot, you are able to get a reservation at any restaurant of your liking!

### For whom?
Whoever wants to get a reservation at a restaurant of their choosing.

### How?
Web app where you can select a restaurant and timing(s) of when you want to go. Resy Bot will then wait for the reservation to be open and snipe it instantly, then will email or send a text message regarding the reservation. 

### Scope
Project is reasonable for 4-6 people as the front-end is intuitive (simply inputting a restaurant's resy link) and the backend logic should be challenging enough to take time (we would need to constantly monitor active/open user requests), while it does not seem to be too challenging (same idea as implementing a sneaker bot, which does not seem too difficult).
